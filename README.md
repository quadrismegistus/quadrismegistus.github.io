I am Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities at the University of Cambridge, where I teach for [Cambridge Digital Humanities](http://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/) and the Faculty of English. I am a literary historian and computational humanist with fifteen years of experience in researching and teaching in the digital humanities.

My research and pedagogy span topics from the history and theory of DH to its methodological groundings in data science and visualization, natural language processing, network theory, machine learning, and large language models. My work focuses on computational approaches to prosody and rhythm, literary and intellectual history, and the history and impact of artificial intelligence on language.

I completed my PhD in English from Stanford University in 2019, where I was a founding member of the Stanford Literary Lab and its Associate Research Director from 2011 to 2015. From 2019-2022 I was Junior Research Fellow in King's College, Cambridge, where I supervised students in English literature and Practical Criticism, taught workshops in the Center for Digital Humanities, and helped to review and establish its MPhil program. From 2022-2024 I was Research Software Engineer in Princeton's Center for Digital Humanities.
