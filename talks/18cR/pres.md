# Abstraction in Hegel

<u>This is abstract thinking: to see nothing in the murderer except the abstract fact that he is a murderer</u>, and to annul all other human essence in him with this simple quality. ...

In quite a different manner <u>I once heard a common old woman who worked in a hospital kill the abstraction of the murderer</u> and bring him to life for honor. The severed head had been placed on the scaffold, and the sun was shining. How beautifully, she said, the sun of God's grace shines on Binder's head! — You are not worthy of having the sun shine on you, one says to a rascal with whom one is angry. This woman saw that the murderer's head was struck by the sunshine and thus was still worthy of it. She raised it from the punishment of the scaffold into the sunny grace of God, and instead of accomplishing the reconciliation with violets and sentimental vanity, saw him accepted in grace in the higher sun.

—Hegel, ‘Who thinks abstractly’ (1808)

# Abstraction in Locke

The use of words then being to stand as outward marks of our internal ideas, and those ideas being taken from particular things, if every particular idea that we take in should have a distinct name, names must be endless. To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas, received from particular objects, to become general; which is done by considering them as they are in the mind, such appearances, separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as time, place, or any other concomitant ideas. <u>This is called ABSTRACTION, whereby Ideas taken from particular Beings, become general Representatives of all of the same kind</u>; and their Names general Names, applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract Ideas. ... Thus the same Colour being observed to day in Chalk or Snow, which the Mind yesterday received from Milk, it considers that Appearance alone, makes it a representative of all of that kind; and having given it the name Whiteness, it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagin’d or met with; and thus Universals, whether Ideas or Terms, are made.

—John Locke, *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1689), II.xi.9

# Abstraction in Aristotle

The so-called abstract objects the mind thinks just as, in the case of the snub [nose], one might think of it qua snub not separately, but <u>if anyone actually thought of it qua hollow he would think of it without the flesh in which it is embodied</u>: it is thus that the mind when it is thinking the objects of mathematics thinks of them as separate though they are not separate. In every case the mind which is actively thinking is the objects which it thinks. Whether it is possible for it while not existing separate from spatial conditions to think anything that is separate, or not, we must consider later.

—Aristotle, *De Anima*, 431b12

# Abstraction in Marx

It was an immense step forward for Adam Smith to throw out every limiting specification of wealth-creating activity – not only manufacturing, or commercial or agricultural labour, but one as well as the others, labour in general. […] Now, it might seem that all that had been achieved thereby was to discover the abstract expression for the simplest and most ancient relation in which human beings – in whatever form of society – play the role of producers. This is correct in one respect. Not in another. Indifference towards any specific kind of labour presupposes a very developed totality of real kinds of labour, of which no single one is any longer predominant.

<u>As a rule, the most general abstractions arise only in the midst of the richest possible concrete development</u>, where one thing appears as common to many, to all. Then it ceases to be thinkable in a particular form alone.

—Karl Marx, _Grundrisse_ (1858 [1993]), p. 98

---
# Abstraction in Koselleck

<u>A defining experience of the modern world is the loss of those specific and particularistic terms which once designated social conditions. For this reason many older concepts</u>, increasingly overtaken by events or changes in social structures that they could no longer either articulate or explain, <u>became more and more abstract</u>. From that time on, the use of collective singular nouns proliferated. Concrete usages such as stories or histories (_Geschichten_) were replaced by the more abstract term history (_Geschichte an sich_). Separate advances in one or another field now were lumped together as progress.

—Reinhart Koselleck, _Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe_, “Introduction” (1972)

# Realism and concreteness

The novel arose in the modern period, a period whose general intellectual orientation was most decisively separated from its classical and mediaeval heritage by its rejection ... [of] the view held by the scholastic Realists of the Middle Ages that it is universals, classes or abstractions, and not the <u>particular, concrete objects of sense-perception, which are the true 'realities'</u>.

—Ian Watt, Rise of the Novel (1957)

--

<br/>
<br/>
It will be appropriate to associate rise of affect with the emergence of the phenomenological body in language and representation; and to <u>historicize a competition between the system of named emotions and the emergence of nameless bodily states</u> which can be documented in literature around the middle of the nineteenth century (literary representation furnishing the most comprehensive evidence as to a momentous yet impossibly hypothetical historical transformation of this kind). […] it is therefore words themselves (the <u>medieval universals) which are incompatible with the body and its affects</u>.

# Tell, don't show

She is perfectly sure of her own; for--if there were nothing else, and there is much--she has tasted blood, so to speak, in the form of her so prompt and auspicious success with the public, leaving all probations behind (the whole of which, as the book gives it, is too rapid and sudden, though inevitably so: <u>processes, periods, intervals, stages, degrees, connexions, may be easily enough and barely enough named, may be unconvincingly stated, in fiction, to the deep discredit of the writer, but it remains the very deuce to _represent_ them</u>, especially represent them under strong compression and in brief and subordinate terms; and this even though the novelist who doesn't represent, and represent "all the time," is lost, exactly as much lost as the painter who, at his work and given his intention, doesn't paint "all the time").
